1. The Core Goal
Our main goal is to build an impressive, beautiful, and very fast website. It needs to look far more professional and high-tech than a standard template-based site. This project will serve as a key portfolio piece to prove our skill to Thabang and secure a long-term partnership.

2. Design & Feel
"Mobile-First" Design: The website will be designed to look perfect on a mobile phone first. Then, we will adapt that design to look equally beautiful on a desktop.

"Compact & Beautiful" Look: The design will be clean, modern, and uncluttered. We'll use generous whitespace to make the content easy to read and feel professional.

On-Brand: We will strictly follow the client's Brand Kit, using their official colors (blues, greens, grays), fonts (Montserrat for headlines, Open Sans for text), and "glowing" high-tech style.

3. The "Impressive" Feature: The Network Map
Instead of just a boring list, we will build an interactive "Our Network" map.

Desktop: Visitors can see a map of South Africa, click filters for "Billboards" or "Digital Screens," and click on pins to see details for each location (like traffic numbers or a photo).

Mobile: To keep it simple and fast, mobile users will see a clean, filterable list of the locations.

4. Lead Generation (The Money-Making Part)
The site's main job is to get new clients for Thabang.

Instant Email Notifications: When a user fills out any form on the site, Thabang will get an instant email notification with the lead's details, so he can follow up immediately.

Contact Form: A standard, easy-to-use form for clients to "Book a Campaign."

"Smart" Pop-up: We will add a pop-up that offers the "Media Kit" (a valuable download) to visitors who are about to leave the site. We'll make sure it only appears once per user so it's not annoying.

5. Search Engine (Google) Strategy
We will build the site to rank high on Google from day one.

We'll use all the keywords from the business brief (like "Billboards in Soweto" or "Digital Screen Advertising") in the page titles and descriptions.

The site's high speed and mobile-friendly design will also help it rank better.

6. Site Structure (The Pages)
We will use all the text and content Thabang provided in his brief to build out a clear and logical website:

Home Page: A powerful first impression with links to the two main services.

Service Pages: One dedicated page for "Digital Screens" and one for "Billboards."

Our Network: The page with the interactive map.

About Us: A page explaining who they are, their mission, and their values.

Contact: A page with the contact form and other details.
